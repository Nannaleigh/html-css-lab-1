    <p> <strong>Freya</strong> is a three year old german-shepard mix from Salt Lake City, Utah. She is named after the norse goddess of love and war and takes living up to that name very seriously. Freya 
    was one of thirteen brothers and sisters and knew a thing or two about showing her brothers who was boss! Her favorite toy is anything that squeaks and she especially loves to 
    dig through all the fluff to get the squeaky center. No toy lasts forever once she gets her paws on it! She also loves chewing on various types of bones or stick toys
     and can often be found relaxing with one at the end of the day. <br>
     <br>
     Freya also enjoys pestering the resident cat and finding new ways to drive him crazy. 
     She loves messing around with her littlest human and winning at tug-o-war and especially loves wrestling in the grass. 
     She is not a fan of crows or magpies and is always quick to let them know they are not 
     welcome in or around her people and especially not in her yard. 
     Though she sometimes forgets the difference between her toys and human-things 
     (like books, remote controls, hats, and of course the occasional shoe), she is still a very good pupper. &hearts;
